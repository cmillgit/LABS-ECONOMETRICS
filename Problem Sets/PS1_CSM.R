#1 - WARM UP

#2 - Wooldridge, 1.1
#1.i 
# To conduct an experiment, I would establish 3 different class sizes (Small, Medium, and Large), each class consisting of identical lectures.
# Students would be randomly assigned to one of the 3 class sizes.
# After each class, the students would be uniformly quizzed over the lecture material.
# Upon completion of the quizzes, each quiz would be graded.
# After grading, the mean scores for each class size would be computed.
# The experiment would be replicated several times and I would compare the performance of each class size across all trials to determine the correlation between class size and student performance.

#1.ii
# I may expect a negative correlation between class size and test scores for several reasons.
# One reason why test scores may decrease as class size increases is that teachers may be time constrained, and as class size increases the amount of time to help individual students decreases.
# Another reason is that larger class sizes may allow for more distraction, and students in larger classes would be less focused on the material in class.

#1.iii
# A negative correlation wouldn't necessarily show that smaller class sizes cause better performance because of the many unobservable factors that could be at play.
# One reason is that students may have differing cognitive ability.
# Another reason is that wealth may determine class size. For example, private schools may have smaller class sizes and the students at these schools may have access to more resources than students in a public school.

#3 - Wooldridge, 1.C2
#C2.i
# There are 1388 women in the sample and 212 of them reported smoking during pregnancy.

#C2.ii
# The average number of cigarettes smoked per day is approximately 2.09.
# This is not a good measure of the "typical" woman in this case because nearly 85% of the women in the study reported smoking zero cigarettes while pregnant.

#C2.iii
# Among the women who reported smoking during pregnancy, the average number of cigarettes smoked per day was approximately 13.67.
# This is average is much higher because it does not include those who did not report smoking, and the outliers in this condition carry more weight.

#C2.iv
# The average number of years of education among the fathers is about 13.19.
# This only includes 1192 observations because it subtracted the NA values in the data.

#C2.v
# The average family income is approximately $29,030.
# The standard deviation of family income is $18,739.28.

#4 - Wooldridge, 2.C3
#C3.i
# sleep = 3586.38 - 0.15totwrk minutes spent sleeping at night during the week.
# Total observations = 706
# R^2 = 0.103
# The intercept indicates that when zero minutes are worked during the week, the estimated amount of sleep is approximately 3856.38 minutes per week.

#C3.ii
# If totwrk increases by 2 hours, sleep is estimated to fall by 18.084 minutes per week.
# This seems to be a small effect in the short term, but the cumulative effect over time could be significant.

#Cooldown - Wooldridge, 2.1
#1.i
# Factors contained in u may include socioeconomic and health variables.
# These factors are likely to be correlated with levels of education. For example, women from higher income families may be able to afford to go to college.

#1.ii
# An SLR regression analysis will uncover the ceteris paribus issue by holding all unobservable factors constant, allowing us to see a relationship between fertility and education.
